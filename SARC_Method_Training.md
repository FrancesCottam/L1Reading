HEALTHY EATING ON A BUDGET

Introduction
Eating well doesn't have to be expensive. With some simple planning, you can enjoy nutritious meals without breaking the bank.

Plan Your Meals
• Make a weekly menu
• Check what you already have
• Create a shopping list

Shop Smart
Look for special offers but only buy what you need. Supermarket own-brands are often just as good as expensive brands.

Cook at Home
Preparing meals yourself saves money and lets you control what goes into your food. Batch cooking means you can freeze portions for busy days.
```

**Interactive task:**
After 45 seconds, answer WITHOUT re-reading:
1. What is this text about?
2. How many main sections are there?
3. What organizational features did you notice?

MOBILE PHONE SAFETY

Recent research has shown that young people spend an average of 7 hours per day looking at screens. While smartphones are useful tools, excessive use can lead to several health problems.

Physical Effects
Looking down at your phone puts strain on your neck and spine. Doctors call this 'tech neck' and warn it can cause long-term damage. Additionally, staring at screens reduces your blink rate, which can dry out your eyes.

Sleep Disruption  
The blue light from screens tells your brain it's daytime. Using phones before bed can make it harder to fall asleep and reduce sleep quality. Experts recommend switching off devices at least one hour before bedtime.

Mental Wellbeing
Constant notifications and social media comparisons can increase stress and anxiety. Taking regular breaks from your phone helps you stay present and reduces feelings of being overwhelmed.

What You Can Do
Set screen time limits on your device. Take a 5-minute break every hour. Keep phones out of the bedroom at night. These small changes can make a big difference to your health.
```

**Question:** "According to the text, 'tech neck' is caused by..."
a) spending 7 hours on screens
